    <h1>Compound Interest: A Game Changer for Retirees</h1>
    
    <h2>Make Your Retirement Savings Last Longer</h2>
    <p>As a retiree, compound interest can help you maintain financial security by growing your savings and reducing the risk of outliving your money.</p>
    
    <h2>How Compound Interest Works in Retirement</h2>
    <p>Unlike younger investors who are in the "accumulation phase," retirees shift to the preservation phase. Your goal is to maximize returns while protecting capital.</p>

    <h3>Even in retirement, your investments can still grow through compounding if you:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep a portion of your portfolio in dividend stocks, ETFs, or managed funds.</li>
        <li>Reinvest dividends and interest instead of withdrawing all your returns.</li>
        <li>Use term deposits and bonds that offer compound interest.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Example: The Power of Compounding Even After Retirement</h2>
    <p>Let's say you retire with $500,000 and keep it invested at 5% annual interest, withdrawing only $20,000 per year for living expenses. Instead of running out of money in 25 years, compounding helps your balance last much longer -- possibly beyond 30 years!</p>
    
    <h2>How to Use Compound Interest in Retirement</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Superannuation & Pension Funds</strong> &nbsp;-- Many retirees leave money in their superannuation to continue compounding tax-free.</li>
        <li> <strong>Dividend Stocks & ETFs</strong> &nbsp;-- Investments that pay dividends keep your money growing while providing passive income.</li>
        <li> <strong>Avoid High-Interest Debt</strong> &nbsp;-- Credit card debt can compound against you and erode savings.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Even in retirement, compound interest can extend your savings and secure your financial future. By keeping your money invested wisely, you can enjoy your retirement without financial stress!</p>
