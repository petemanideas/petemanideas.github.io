    <h1>The Power of Compound Interest: Why Young Investors Should Start Now</h1>
    
    <h2>Time is Your Greatest Asset</h2>
    <p>If you're a young investor, compound interest is your best friend. The earlier you start investing, the more time your money will have to grow exponentially.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Compound Interest?</h2>
    <p>Compound interest is when you earn interest on both your initial investment and the interest already earned. This creates a snowball effect where your money grows faster over time.</p>
    
    <h3>For example, if you invest $5,000 at 7% annual interest and contribute $200 per month, here's how much you could have:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 10 years: ~$39,000</li>
        <li>In 20 years: ~$105,000</li>
        <li>In 30 years: ~$243,000</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now imagine if you waited 10 years to start investing. You would have less than half as much money at retirement!</p>

    <h2>Why Young Investors Have the Biggest Advantage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>More Time = More Growth</strong> -- Even small amounts grow significantly over decades.</li>
        <li><strong>Less Risk Needed</strong> -- You don't have to chase high-risk investments; time does the work.</li>
        <li><strong>Compounding Turns Small Savings into Wealth</strong> -- A small investment today can be a fortune tomorrow.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>How to Start Investing Now</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Open a high-interest savings account or a superannuation fund with compounding returns.</li>
        <li>Start automated monthly investments in index funds, ETFs, or shares.</li>
        <li>Avoid unnecessary debt -- compound interest works against you on credit cards and loans.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Your biggest advantage as a young investor is time. Even if you start with just $50 or $100 per month, compounding will grow your wealth effortlessly. The key? Start today and be consistent!</p>
